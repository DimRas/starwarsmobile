// Projectiles are handled directly by the Player class
// This file is kept for structure consistency, but could be used
// for more complex projectile types in the future

// Different projectile types could be implemented here:
// - Spread shot
// - Laser beam
// - Homing missiles
// - Bouncing projectiles
